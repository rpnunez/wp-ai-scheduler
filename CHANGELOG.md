# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- 2024-05-28: Fixed infinite loop in schedule processing where failed "One Time" schedules were incorrectly rescheduled for the next day. They are now deactivated upon failure.

### Added
- 2024-05-27: Added bulk deletion functionality to the Generation History page (Select All/Individual checkboxes, Delete Selected button).
- 2026-01-06: Added configurable featured image sources (AI prompt, Unsplash keywords, or Media Library selection) for templates.
- 2026-01-16: Added "Run Now" button to the Schedules list to trigger immediate execution of a specific schedule.

### Performance
- 2026-01-16: Added composite index `(is_active, next_run)` to `aips_schedule` and index `(is_active)` to `aips_templates` to optimize scheduler polling queries.

### UX
- 2026-01-16: Improved copy button feedback in Admin UI to preserve icons on standard buttons and show a checkmark on small icon-only buttons.

### Fixed
- 2024-05-24: Fixed PHPUnit test compatibility issues by adding `: void` return type to `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods in test classes, ensuring tests run correctly in limited mode without the WordPress test library.

### Performance
- 2024-05-24: Implemented transient caching for History statistics (`AIPS_History_Repository::get_stats`) to reduce database load on dashboard and history pages.

### Fixed
- 2024-05-23: Improved log reading performance by replacing O(N) `SplFileObject` seek with O(1) `fseek` tail reading, preventing potential crashes on large log files.
- 2024-05-22: Removed redundant HTTP response code check in `AIPS_Generator::generate_and_upload_featured_image` to improve code quality and maintainability.
### Added
- [2025-12-21 01:48:42] Added search functionality to the Generation History page to filter posts by title.
- [2024-05-22 10:00:00] Refactored Scheduler: Extracted AJAX handlers to `AIPS_Schedule_Controller`, enhanced `AIPS_Scheduler` with better topic and next_run support, and updated `AIPS_Planner` to use the Scheduler service instead of direct SQL.
- [2024-05-22 10:00:00] Made generated topic titles editable in the Planner before scheduling.
