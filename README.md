# AI Post Scheduler - WordPress Plugin

Schedule AI-generated posts using Meow Apps AI Engine. Build reusable templates, research topics, bulk-schedule content, and monitor every AI call from one dashboard.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Development

### Using Docker (Recommended)

Get up and running in minutes with our Docker development environment:

```bash
# One command to rule them all
./start-dev.sh
```

That's it! In 2-5 minutes you'll have:
- ✅ WordPress 6.4 with PHP 8.2
- ✅ MariaDB 10.6 database
- ✅ Plugin installed and activated
- ✅ Xdebug ready for debugging
- ✅ phpMyAdmin for database management

**Access your development environment:**
- **WordPress**: http://localhost:8080
- **Admin**: http://localhost:8080/wp-admin (admin/admin)
- **phpMyAdmin**: http://localhost:8082

**Start debugging in VS Code:**
1. Open project in VS Code
2. Press `F5`
3. Select "Listen for Xdebug (Docker)"
4. Set breakpoints and start coding!
