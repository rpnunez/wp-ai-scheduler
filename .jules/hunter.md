## 2024-05-25 - Schedule Initialization Logic Flaw
**Learning:** Using `calculate_next_run(interval, start_time)` for *initial* schedule creation is incorrect because it calculates `start_time + interval`, effectively skipping the first run.
**Action:** When creating schedules, always treat `start_time` as the explicit *first* execution time (`next_run`), rather than a base for calculation. Only use `calculate_next_run` for subsequent recurring executions.
