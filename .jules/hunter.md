## 2024-12-28 - Schedule Drift & Catch-up Fix
**Learning:** Calculating next run times based on `current_time` (execution time) causes permanent schedule drift. Also, blindly resetting past times to "now" can cause immediate re-execution loops.
**Action:** Changed `calculate_next_run` to anchor on the *scheduled* time, effectively preserving the phase (e.g., "10:00"). Added loop to skip missed intervals (catch-up) without running them, ensuring the next run is in the future.
