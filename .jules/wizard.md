# Feature Wizard's Journal 🧙‍♂️

## 2024-05-23 - Client-side Search for Templates
**Learning:** `templates.php` loads all records at once, but lacked search functionality, forcing users to scan manually.
**Action:** Implemented client-side filtering (Name/Category) with a "Clear" button and empty state handling, reusing standard WP inputs.

## 2024-05-25 - Planner UI Improvements
**Learning:** Users needed a way to clear the brainstormed topic list and copy selected topics to clipboard for external use.
**Action:** Implemented "Clear List" (with confirmation) and "Copy Selected" buttons in the Planner toolbar, updating admin-planner.js to handle clipboard interactions.

## 2024-05-27 - History Bulk Actions
**Learning:** The history table lacked bulk deletion capabilities, forcing users to delete failed/unwanted entries one by one or clear the entire history.
**Action:** Implemented "Select All" / Individual checkboxes and a "Delete Selected" button in `history.php`, backed by a new `delete_bulk` repository method and AJAX handler.

## 2024-05-29 - Run Schedule Now
**Learning:** Reusing existing AJAX handlers with a `data-context` attribute is a clean way to support multiple triggers for similar backend actions without duplicating JS code.
**Action:** Apply this pattern when adding context-specific triggers to existing features.
