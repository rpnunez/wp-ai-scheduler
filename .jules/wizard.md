## 2024-05-23 - Client-side Search for Templates
**Learning:** `templates.php` loads all records at once, but lacked search functionality, forcing users to scan manually.
**Action:** Implemented client-side filtering (Name/Category) with a "Clear" button and empty state handling, reusing standard WP inputs.

## 2024-05-25 - Planner UI Improvements
**Learning:** Users needed a way to clear the brainstormed topic list and copy selected topics to clipboard for external use.
**Action:** Implemented "Clear List" (with confirmation) and "Copy Selected" buttons in the Planner toolbar, updating admin-planner.js to handle clipboard interactions.

## 2024-05-25 - Settings Usability
**Learning:** Static lists of ID/Key fields (like template variables) are a common friction point where users manually select and copy text.
**Action:** Added one-click "Copy" buttons (with visual success feedback) to the Template Variables table in Settings, using a reusable `copyToClipboard` function.
