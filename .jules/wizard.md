## 2024-05-23 - Client-side Search for Templates
**Learning:** `templates.php` loads all records at once, but lacked search functionality, forcing users to scan manually.
**Action:** Implemented client-side filtering (Name/Category) with a "Clear" button and empty state handling, reusing standard WP inputs.

**Action:** Added a cohesive "Toolbar" with "Copy Selected" and "Clear List" actions, providing immediate utility and better list management.
